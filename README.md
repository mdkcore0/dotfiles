dotfiles
========

yup, finally

Using [dotbot](https://github.com/anishathalye/dotbot) to manage, err... my dotfiles ;)

Just clone and run *./.install* (configuration on *.install.conf.yaml*)

Note for Slackware users
------------------------

As my main operating system is [Slackware](http://www.slackware.com/), I let some packages I've built for my own use on my server. They are built against slackware-current x86_64, and you can grab them on the following links:
* [i3](http://thecoreme.org/slack/pkgs/x86_64/i3/): also including some additional tools
* [mutt](http://thecoreme.org/slack/pkgs/x86_64/mutt/): based on the [official SlackBuild](http://mirrors.slackware.com/slackware/slackware64-current/source/n/mutt/), just applying some additional patches, [see here](http://thecoreme.org/slack/pkgs/SlackBuilds/mutt.tar.xz) my version (with patches from [mutt-sidebar](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/mutt-sidebar/))
